pmxar, a Mac and iOS app to display Miku Miku Dance models and motions in Augmented Reality
Copyright Â© 2018-2019 Lyuma

This is mostly a code dump. Not sure it builds in this form.
Heavily Apple-specific code.

There are lots of bugs with physics, and IK has some bugs that cause the legs to spin, for example.

The code has not been updated since 2019, so it is missing some of the newer AR features.
Make sure to run ./prepare_bullet.sh to install the bullet code properly into the xcode project.
